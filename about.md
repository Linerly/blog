## Hi there! 👋

I am just a student from Indonesia, and I occasionally make things and share it in my website (or in my blog, perhaps) like games, artworks, programs, and more.
[I'm also available on other social media platforms.](https://linerly.github.io/social-media)

Also, I use Arch Linux, BTW.

If you want to, feel free to [donate through PayPal](https://paypal.me/linerly) or give me some Monero at this address: 43mp6J3yd8R1378BeYgYHVW23MHfnmNde3CzuNaY3mDmhr3mkMUrWYC4PHFAbVv4Ujf9Mqdy6dQbjGr83bssNq8xDncHZid

Oh yeah, if you don't want to miss out new articles that I post here, [my blog has an RSS feed that you can subscribe to.](https://linerly.github.io/blog/feed)

That's all for now :)
